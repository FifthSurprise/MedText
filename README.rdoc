Coding Challenge From MedText.

This coding challenge is a location system.  Given a database of addresses (ie. practices), the application will find the closest practice to any given separate address (or zip code).


This is running off of an Sqlite3 database.

To start, download the application and run the following commands:

* rake db:create
* rake db:migrate
* rake db:seed
* rails server
